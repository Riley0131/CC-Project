University of Colorado Colorado Springs

## Structure
### Pull Modules
This file pulls the modules from each enrolled course for the student and seperates the urls by type (youtube video, embedded Canvas video, other)  

### youtubeVideo
This file will only go through the youtube filetypes and use the youtube api to determine if the video contains captions (only recognizes embedded captions)
